# Weather Web App (Weather.io)

## Project Overview
This Weather Web App is a simple and intuitive web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city around the world. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it fetches real-time weather data from a public API and displays key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description. The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

## Features
- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches live weather data for any city using an external weather API.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for weather conditions in any city.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile views.
- **Interactive UI**: Displays clear weather icons and relevant metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the app responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic, API calls, and dynamic content rendering.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a city name in the search bar.
2. The app fetches weather data from a public API.
3. Weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description are displayed dynamically on the page.

## API Integration
The app utilizes [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch current weather data. You can create a free account on the OpenWeatherMap website and generate an API key to use in the project.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a forecast feature to display weather predictions for the next few days.
- Include a "Current Location" option to automatically fetch weather data based on the user's geolocation.
- Add customizable themes based on current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter the city name to check the weather conditions.

## Avoiding Conflicts {Syncing Your Fork}

To keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository and avoid conflicts:

1. **Add Upstream Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/clubgamma/hacktoberfest2024.git
   ```

2. **Verify the New Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Sync Your Fork with Upstream:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   This will pull in changes from the parent repository and help you resolve any conflicts.

4. **Keep Updated:**
   - Regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to keep your fork updated.
